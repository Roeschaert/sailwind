Compute available bearings relating to winddirection
Ex : bearings available by a norderly wind sharp it would be about 45째and more to starboard and 315째 and less to port .
Some boats can go sharper to the wind perhaps 35째 to starboard and 305째 to port so this would be a parameter to give to the program .
